            <h2>React Weather Project</h2>
            <p>This React Weather Project was a chance for us to showcase our skills in React, while utulizing API's. The application has the ability to search any city in the world
                and provide feedback on the date, day, time, current weather as well as the weekly weather report. This was my first project in React and although challenging, this
                project taught me skills that I will be able to utulize in futre career. Click on the link to see it for yourself! üëáüèº

            <h2>Responsive-PopCulture Gems </h2>
            <p>This application was built to enhance our Responsive skills with CSS Grids, filters, Hero, and Embeds. Thisd site is by far my favorite build. 
                I was able to have fun with colors; if there is anything that shows off my personality the best, it is this site. The focus was Pop Culture in
                film and art. Since it was the holidays when I built this site and I am from a city near Cleveland, ohio, I chose A Christmas Story.
                With a recent visit to The Andy Wahol Museum, I had to be biased as a Northeastern Ohio woman as well, and include a little bit about his genius;
                with 7 floors of Art, you become immersed in what he has created. Believe it or not, this visit further inspired me in my Codinf journey. I have so 
                much gratitude for the technological world we live in. I want to create dynamic tools and beautiful applications that help people. Click below to check

        <h2>React Dictionary Application</h2>
        <p>This React Application further strengthened my skills in React utulizing API and Search Engine integration in order to pull information such as, and not limited to, 
            the searched word, the searched words adjective, noun, verd, and a photo. This project was challenging and is one that I am proud of. I believe that this is a project
            that will highlight my skills in React. I am very happy with my design and the overall capability of this application. I hope to builf more like this in the future.
